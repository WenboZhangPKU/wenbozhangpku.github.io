  <p>
    My research focuses on the long-term evolution of terrestrial bodies in our solar system, such as the Moon and Io.
    For my research paradigm, I usually look for scientific problems from observations and then try to address them 
    using geophysical approaches, e.g., mantle convection and tidal dissipation modeling.
    Currently, I am visting at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) as a joint PhD student, working with Dr. Meng Tian.
    I am always looking forward to collaborating with researchers worldwide. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me!
