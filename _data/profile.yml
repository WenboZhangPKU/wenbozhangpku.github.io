  <p>
    My research focuses on the long-term evolution of terrestrial bodies in our solar system, such as the Moon and Io.
    My research paradigm is firstly identifying scientific problems inspired by observations and then trying to address them
    basaed on geophysical approaches, e.g., mantle convection and tidal dissipation modeling.
    Currently, I am visting at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) as a joint PhD student, working with Dr. Meng Tian.
    I am always looking forward to collaborating with researchers worldwide. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me!
