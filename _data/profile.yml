  <p>
    My research focuses on the evolution of terrestrial bodies in our solar system, such as the Moon and Io. <br/>
    My tenet is first identifying scientific problems inspired by observations and then addressing them
    using geophysical approaches, e.g., mantle convection and tidal dissipation modeling. <br/>
    I am currently a visiting PhD student at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen, in the Universit채ts-Sternwarte M체nchen, working with Dr. Meng Tian.
    I am always eager to collaborate with researchers worldwide. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me!
